# Machine Learning for Graph and Sequential Data Projects

This repository contains a series of coding assignments for the course "Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data". Each directory represents a separate project exploring different concepts and applications of machine learning techniques on graphs and sequential data. Below is a brief overview of each project:

### 1. Hidden Markov Models (`ex1_hmm`)
This project focuses on the implementation and application of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to sequential data. The goal is to understand the basics of HMMs, including state transitions and emission probabilities, and how they can be used to model sequential processes.

### 2. Word2Vec Implementation (`ex2_word2vec`)
An exploration into the Word2Vec model for word embeddings. This project involves implementing the Word2Vec algorithm from scratch, understanding the concept of word embeddings, and how these representations capture semantic relationships between words.

### 3. Temporal Point Processes (`ex3_tpp`)
This project delves into Temporal Point Processes (TPP) and their applications in modeling time-dependent events. The focus is on understanding the mathematical foundations of TPPs and implementing models to analyze event sequences.

### 4. Spectral Clustering (`ex4_spectral_clustering`)
An investigation into spectral clustering techniques for graph data. This project covers the theory behind spectral clustering, the construction of similarity graphs, and how to use eigenvectors of graph Laplacians for clustering tasks.

### 5. Graph Neural Networks (`ex5_gnn`)
This final project explores the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their application to graph-structured data. It includes implementing GNN models and understanding how they leverage graph topology to perform node classification, link prediction, and other graph-related tasks.

## Requirements

Each project may have specific dependencies and requirements. Refer to the `requirements.txt` file within each project directory for the list of necessary Python packages.
